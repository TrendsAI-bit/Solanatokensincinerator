Frequently asked questions about Bonkseus Incinerator and token burning.

## üî• Token Burning Basics

### What is token burning?
Token burning is the permanent removal of cryptocurrency tokens from circulation. When tokens are burned, they are destroyed and cannot be recovered, effectively reducing the total supply forever.

### Why would I want to burn my tokens?
There are several reasons to burn tokens:
- **Clean up your wallet** by removing unwanted or worthless tokens
- **Earn ASH rewards** through our proportional reward system
- **Support tokenomics** by reducing circulating supply
- **Portfolio management** to focus on preferred assets
- **Participate in deflationary economics** that may benefit all holders

### Are burned tokens really gone forever?
Yes, absolutely. Token burning on Solana is irreversible. Once tokens are burned using the SPL Token Program's burn instruction, they are permanently destroyed and cannot be recovered by anyone.

### Can I burn any Solana token?
You can burn any SPL token that you own. This includes all tokens built on the Solana blockchain using the SPL Token standard. The platform automatically detects all your token holdings.

## üí∞ ASH Reward System

### How are ASH rewards calculated?
ASH rewards follow this formula:
```
ASH Earned = (Tokens Burned √∑ 1,000,000) √ó 1,000
```

**Examples:**
- Burn 1,000 tokens ‚Üí Earn 1 ASH
- Burn 100,000 tokens ‚Üí Earn 100 ASH
- Burn 1,000,000 tokens ‚Üí Earn 1,000 ASH

### What are ASH tokens used for?
ASH tokens serve multiple purposes:
- **Governance rights** to vote on platform decisions
- **Tier benefits** with Bronze, Silver, and Gold status levels
- **Fee discounts** on future burn transactions
- **Exclusive access** to special features and events
- **Staking rewards** (planned feature)

### What are the reward tiers?
- **ü•â Bronze (1,000+ ASH)**: Basic rewards and community access
- **ü•à Silver (10,000+ ASH)**: Enhanced benefits and early access features
- **ü•á Gold (50,000+ ASH)**: Premium rewards and governance participation

### Do I get bonus ASH for higher tiers?
Yes! Higher tiers receive bonus multipliers:
- **Bronze**: 1.0x (no bonus)
- **Silver**: 1.1x (10% bonus)
- **Gold**: 1.25x (25% bonus)

### Do I need SOL to burn tokens?
Yes, you need a small amount of SOL (usually 0.000005-0.01 SOL) to pay for transaction fees. This is a standard Solana network requirement for all transactions.

### Why do some tokens show as "Unknown"?
Some tokens may display as "TOKEN_XXXX" because:
- They're new tokens without metadata
- They're custom or private tokens
- Metadata sources don't have information about them
- **You can still burn these tokens safely**

### How long do burn transactions take?
Burn transactions typically confirm within:
- **Normal conditions**: 400-800ms

### What if I accidentally burn the wrong amount?
